Valley fold the lower left side up and in until the edge of this side meets the bottom edge of your previously folded top portions. Fold the top right edge of the paper in until it meets the crease at the center of the paper. Pleat the top of the shape, positioning the pleating so that the mountain fold hits the crease separating the tip of the structure from the main part of the rectangular body. Fold the top left edge in the same way so that it meets at the center crease. Valley fold to the center crease. Fold the lowest corner of the center diamond up so that it meets somewhere along the center of the upper tip, but not quite at the very top. Mountain fold a narrow strip just above this valley fold to complete the pleat. Valley fold the diagonal bottom sides in as far as they will go without ripping. Valley fold along the bottom-most crease you can find.Rotate the model until the largest triangle, which forms the tail, can rest on the table. This step completes your origami T-Rex.",
